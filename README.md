# Loan Plugin for Minecraft

Commands:
- `/loan (User you're loaning to) (Amount you're loaning) (Amount they need to pay back)` Sends a message to the player you are loaning to with the amount they are getting loaned and the amount they need to pay back
- `/loanaccept (User loaning you money)` Accepts the loan but you need to accept in 120 seconds or the loan times out
- `/loanpay (Amount)` Pays down your loan
- `/loanlist` Lists all the loans you have give out or the loan you have

You can give out as many loans as you have money for but the player you loan the money to can only have one loan at a time and a player who has been loaned money can't loan out any money with this plugin.

Needs a MariaDB Database to work plugin won't start with out it.

This may change as i make the plugin.
